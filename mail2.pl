Bondhu,
You got it correct but mutation we want to make in Xeno and want ur suggestion which would be the best substitution in terms of energy. We want to see if at all this residue has some role in chitin binding.
So
now the reading for the  of
Api
1 microgram= 47.62 picomol
10 microgram would be= 476.2 picomol

Apical+intermediate
1microgram=32.26 picomol
10microgram=322.6 picomol

Wt
1microgram=16.67 picomol
10 microgram= 166.7 picomol
hope this one does to u
and suggest me the residue so that i could order the primer ASAP
bye
cheers

    Cheers,

Bandhu curve fitting ke linear fit ka result mast aayaa hai.
Just to be sure, please share the formula you have used for the concentration conversion so that I can recheck (formula not values!).
So the equation here is y=mx+c.

Brief results:
    Ap        ApIp        Fl               
c    6.6375260    7.206661    9.430271
m    0.0063442    0.010554    0.020513
p-val    0.02061        0.02608        0.04145

This is pretty cool as you can see that m of Fl is twice ApIp which is 1 1/2 of Ap!
