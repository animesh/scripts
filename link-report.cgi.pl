=head1 NAME

link-report.cgi - provide an interface for querying the database of links

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This system provides a (deliberately simple) way to query the database
of links and see what is available.  It is designed to be called as a
cgi script and as such should be run from an http server.  It will
output all of the requested information as an HTML document preceded
by HTTP headers.

This program is normally run from a hardwired script created by
configure-link-cgi.  These scripts set the various configuration
variables described below.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There are two options for configuring this program.  Since the program
is designed to be run as a CGI, instead of accepting command line
options, it normally expects to be run with configuration variables
already defined.  A suitable script which does this can be generated
with B<configure-link-cgi>.

The programs configuration comes from the file .cgi-infostruc.pl in the
directory where it is run.  If you want it to use a different
configuration file you should take a copy of the program and change
this in the source.  Usage is arranged like this because it seems more
secure.

=head1 PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be passed from the cgi form

=head2 infostructure

If the value evaluates true in perl (isn't 0 or the empty string) the
report will report on links within the infostructure.  Otherwise the
report will be against the full database.

=head2 repair

If the value evaluates true in perl (isn't 0 or the empty string) the
report will actually be a series of forms which can be used for
repairing the infostructure via the fix-link.cgi cgi-bin.

=head2 urllist

The value will be taken as a space separated list of urls which can be
examined.

=head1 BUGS

The program should say something like no links found when it is
generating zero output.
