Nice article titled "Opening Up to the Rest of the World" which has appeared in a not-so-open Journal called Science (I wish I could share/clip). Anyways it is about Antoine de Daruvar’s [ https://www.labri.fr/publications/mabiovis/?author=de+Daruvar&title=&year=-1&display=list&full=true&x=&y= ] latest efforts to make Bioinformatics teaching more interesting. 
Their assignment was to write a computer application to help
biologists search genetic databases, and Daruvar is eager to test-drive the results.
“Hmmm … is that image free of copyrights?” he asks a duo who have embellished their start page with a picture of a magnifying
